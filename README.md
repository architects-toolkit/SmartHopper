SmartHopper brings the power of AI assistance directly into your Grasshopper workflow! This innovative plugin seamlessly integrates advanced AI capabilities into the Grasshopper environment, enabling architects, engineers, and designers, to enhance their parametric design process.

## 🎯 Why SmartHopper?

- 🖌️ SmartHopper is coded by designers, to designers.
- 🤖 The emerging artificial intelligence revolution is transforming the way we work. SmartHopper is a tool that empowers designers to harness the power of AI in your Grasshopper3D projects.
- ⚖️ SmartHopper is about making choices. It integrates **MistralAI** and **OpenAI** APIs. Provide your own API keys and pay for usage.
- ☁️ **SmartHopper Cloud** *[coming soon]* is a custom implementation of the MistralAI API that enhances the native AI capabilities by adding cascaded prompts and RAG, providing necessary context on the Grasshopper3D environment.

## 👥 Who Is This For?
- **Architects and engineers** looking to enhance their parametric design workflow.
- **Computational designers** seeking AI assistance in their Grasshopper projects.
- Anyone interested in exploring the intersection of AI and parametric design.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- 🌱 Compatible with Data Tree processing in Grasshopper3D.
- ⌚ Asynchronous execution to prevent blocking the canvas.
- 🔄 Run the components with a Button (single manual run) or a Boolean Toggle (run on every input change).
- 🏗️ Optimized for parallel processing.
- 🧱 Clean, modular architecture for stability and future extensibility.

## 🛠️ Installation

SmartHopper is not yet available through Food4Rhino. We will be releasing it soon!
