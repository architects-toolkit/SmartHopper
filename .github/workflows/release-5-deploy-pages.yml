name: 🏁 5 Deploy GitHub Pages on Hash PR Merge

# Description: This workflow deploys GitHub Pages after a hash manifest PR is merged to main.
# It reads all hash files from the /hashes folder in the repository and generates
# a complete versions manifest for the GitHub Pages site.
#
# Triggers:
# - Automatically when a PR to main is closed (and merged)
# - Only processes PRs with title starting with "chore: add provider hash manifest"
#
# Permissions:
# - contents:read - Required to read repository content
# - pages:write - Required to deploy to GitHub Pages
# - id-token:write - Required for GitHub Pages OIDC authentication
