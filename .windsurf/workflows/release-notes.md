The aim is to return the release notes to publish on GitHub.

1. Analyze the last release in CHANGELOG.md

If last release is a major release (1.0.0) or a minor release (0.1.0), follow the following instructions. If it is a patch release (0.0.1) jump to step 3.

2. This step if for major release (1.0.0) and minor release (0.1.0) only:

2.1. Return a title for the release in a code block, in plain text, with this format: "SmartHopper X.X.X(-alpha): Main Release Change". Examples: SmartHopper 0.3.2-alpha: Script Components Unleashed,  SmartHopper 0.3.1-alpha: Tidy Up Your File!, SmartHopper 0.3.0-alpha: Powerful AI tools and enhanced security

2.2. Return the release notes in a markdown code block, following this format:

Brief sentence summarizing the release. (e.g. This alpha release packs powerful undo support, new scripting tools to create and review scripting components, and a sweeping refactor of our AI workflows in Grasshopper‚Äîplus fresh branding and quality-of-life fixes.)

## (emoji) Feature 1
