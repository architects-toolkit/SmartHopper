- We are fully refactoring the code.
- Do not limit yourself to minimal targeted edits. Large high-level refactors or discussion with the user are expected.
- User wants to prioritize best code quality, clear architecture, clean, simple, and easy-to-maintain code.
- If changes introduce breaking changes, don't worry, we'll fix them later.
- Freely remove legacy code. Let the user choose if they want refactoring to be backward compatible.
- Understand the essential logic behind the code and suggest high-level refactors that improve code quality. Wait for human validation of the suggested schema.
