- We are fully refactoring the code.
- Do not limit yourself to minimal targeted edits. Large high-level refactors or discussion with the user are expected.
- User wants to prioritize best code quality, clear architecture, clean, simple, and easy-to-maintain code.
- Place new features as high as possible, to allow reuse and deduplication.
- Edit any related code to match user preferences.
- If changes introduce breaking changes, don't worry, we'll fix them in the future.
- Keep documentation and changelog updates for later. Now focus on rethinking the code.
- Freely remove legacy code. Let the user choose if they want refactoring to be backward compatible or not.
- The result should be ideal code. Don't stack to existing code limitations.
- Understand the essential logic behind the code and suggest high-level refactors that improve code quality. Wait for human validation of the suggested schema.
