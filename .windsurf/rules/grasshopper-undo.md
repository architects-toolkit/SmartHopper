# Grasshopper Undo Rule

## Purpose
Ensure that any code which mutates Grasshopper canvas objects (moving, adding, deleting, wiring, etc.) records an undo event so users can undo with Ctrl+Z.

## Rule
- **Before** mutating any `IGH_DocumentObject` (e.g. setting `Attributes.Pivot`, adding/removing objects, changing wires), insert:
  ```csharp
  obj.RecordUndoEvent("[SH] <Action Description>");
  ```
- For batch or multi-step operations, use the documentâ€™s undo util:
  ```csharp
  var undo = document.UndoUtil.CreateGenericObjectEvent("[SH] Batch Action");
  // for each object change:
  obj.RecordUndoEvent(undo);

## Examples
- MoveInstance
  ```diff
  - var current = obj.Attributes.Pivot;
  + obj.RecordUndoEvent("[SH] Move Instance");
  + var current = obj.Attributes.Pivot;
  ```
- AddObjectToCanvas
  ```diff
  - doc.AddObject(obj, false);
  + obj.RecordUndoEvent("[SH] Add Object");
  + doc.AddObject(obj, false);
  ```

## Enforcement
Code reviews or static analysis should flag any GH canvas mutations missing a preceding RecordUndoEvent or undo-util usage.
