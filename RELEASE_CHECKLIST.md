# Release Checklist

This document outlines the necessary checks before releasing SmartHopper at different stages of development. The checklist is progressive, with more stringent requirements for later stages of release.

## Alpha Release Checklist

Alpha releases are early development versions intended for internal testing and limited external testing. They may contain bugs and incomplete features.

- [ ] README.md is updated with basic installation instructions
- [ ] All dependencies are properly referenced

## Beta Release Checklist

Beta releases are more stable than alpha releases and are intended for wider testing. They may still contain some bugs but should be more feature-complete.

- [ ] Basic user documentation is available
- [ ] Performance testing has been conducted for core functionality
- [ ] Code has been reviewed for obvious security issues

## Release Candidate (RC) Checklist

## Additional Considerations

### Version Compatibility

### Documentation Requirements

- **Alpha**: Basic README and installation instructions
- **Beta**: Core feature documentation and known issues
- **RC**: Complete documentation for all features
- **General**: Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples

### Testing Coverage

- **Alpha**: Basic functionality testing
- **Beta**: Extended functionality and edge case testing
- **RC**: Comprehensive testing including performance and cross-platform
- **General**: Full test suite including regression testing

### Provider Compatibility

- **Alpha**: At least one provider must be functional
- **Beta**: Major providers should be functional
- **RC**: All included providers must be fully functional
- **General**: All providers must be thoroughly tested with their respective services

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Alpha**: Basic functionality is sufficient
- **Beta**: UI should be functional and mostly complete
- **RC**: UI should be polished and consistent
- **General**: UI should be fully polished, consistent, and intuitive
